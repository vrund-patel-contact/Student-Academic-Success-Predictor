# Student-Academic-Success-Predictor

This is a simple linear regression model where we can view the relationship between 2 variables. From our initial dataset, we can see that the "study_hours_per_day" has a correlation percentage of 0.82 with the "exam_score". This is a very high percentage. This implies that there is a high correlation between the number of hours studied by each student and their corresponding exam scores.
